Complete server side development for the login page.
Login page should accept username and password from the user.
Username and password should be validated at the server side with a predefined value.
If correct, give access to the home page.
If incorrect, display incorrect username or password message on the login page.
Home page should contain a signout button. On click signout button - redirect to login page. 
Note: Session handling should work properly. Signout shouldnt happen unless the user presses the signout button. Also, once the user has signed out, the home page shouldnt be loaded on pressing the back button.
